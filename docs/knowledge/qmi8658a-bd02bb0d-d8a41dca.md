- **Internal Pull-ups:** There is an internal 200Kohm pull-up resistor on SCL, SDA, CS, SDx, SCx, and RESV (Pin10). By default, all are enabled. They can be disabled via CTRL9 command.
- **SDO/SA0 Pin:** Has a 200Kohm internal pull-up enabled during Power-On or Soft-Reset. It is automatically disabled after detecting the I2C slave address. In I2C/I3C mode, leaving SDO/SA0 float or connecting it to High (recommended) sets the address to 0x6A. Connecting it to Low sets the address to 0x6B.
- **SPI Mode:** Leave SDO/SA0 pin float in 3-wire SPI mode.
- **SDx/SCx Pins:** Can be connected to VDDIO, Logic High, GND, or Logic Low, or left float if internal pull-ups are enabled.
- **RESV (Pin 10):** Should NOT be connected to GND or Logic Low. It can be connected to VDDIO or Logic High, or left externally floating with the internal pull-up resistor enabled.

Note: 4. Rpu resistors are only needed when the Host Serial Interface is configured for I2C (see I2C Interface section). Inertial
They are not needed when the Host Serial Interface is configured for SPI or I3C. If pull-up resistors are used on
SCL and SDA, then SPI, I3C and I2C Modes are all possible. If a pull-down resistor is used on SA0, an alternate
slave address is used for I2C. SPI and I3C modes will be unaltered with the use of pull-up resistors for I2C.
Additionally, a suitable pull up resistance (Rpu) value should be selected, accounting for the tradeoff between
current consumption and rise time. Measurement

3.3 Power On Sequence of VDDIO and VDD

3.3.1 Power-On Reset(POR) QMI8658A
Once the VDD & VDDIO are powered from 0V to a certain level, the internal power voltage detector will trigger the
Power-On Reset (POR) automatically, and then exit/release the POR mode as the VDD voltage rises over the POR —
Threshold (about 1.1V). Refer to Table 6. 6D
After POR release, there will be about 200us Startup Delay, followed by the QMI8658A Initialization.

The instability of VDDIO & VDD power lines, especially the power increase/drop with high slew rate, would interfere
the QMI8658A Initialization and operation. Therefore, there should be no sudden transients and spikes on power lines after Startup Delay, to make sure the Initialization and later on operations are properly implemented. Inertial

Normally it takes within about 15ms (refer to System Turn On Time in Table 7 and Table 8) for QMI8658A to finish the
Initialization and during which, there should be no write/configuration to QMI8658A, to prevent possible interference
and failure.

Note that the Software Reset is triggered by the reset command that host write to QMI8658A, which means POR is not
involved, while the following sequence are similar (Startup Delay and Initialization) to POR. Refer to 7.4 for more details. Measurement
3.3.2 VDDIO and VDD Are Driven by Single Power Unit
As shown in Figure 11, when QMI8658A is driven by single/same power line, the power line should ramp up from POR with
Threshold (about 1.1V) to Min Operation Voltage(1.71V) with slew rate higher than 40V/s, otherwise the Initialization
might fail, and QMI8658A might not work properly.

<!-- page: 17 -->
3.3.3 VDDIO and VDD Are Driven by Separate Power Lines
As shown in Figure 12, when QMI8658A is driven by separate power lines, the VDDIO should be always powered
ahead of (no later than) VDD, which means: QMI8658A
VDDdelay >= 0, VDDIO should be driven no later than VDD
—
Note that the VDDdelay starts from the point when VDDIO rises over the POR Threshold and ended at the VDD rises
over the POR Threshold. It should always be non-negative. 6D

The power lines should ramp up from POR Threshold (about 1.1V) to Min Operation Voltage(1.71V) with slew rate higher than 40V/s, otherwise the Initialization might fail, and QMI8658A might not work properly. Inertial

3.5 Accelerometer Programmable Characteristics

VDD = VDDIO = 1.8 V, T = 25°C unless otherwise noted. Typical numbers are provided below unless otherwise noted. If only accelerometer is enabled, the ODR frequency is derived from the internal oscillator. If both accelerometer and QMI8658A
gyroscope (6DOF mode) are enabled, the ODR frequency is derived from the natural frequency of gyroscope. Table 9 —
shows the two ODR frequencies, which can be referenced for later descriptions in the datasheet. Refer to section 5.3
for detailed ODR configuration. 6D
RMS noise can be calculated based on the noise density and the bandwidth.

3.9 Temperature Sensor

The QMI8658A is equipped with an internal 16-bit embedded temperature sensor that is automatically turned on by default whenever the accelerometer or gyroscope is enabled. The temperature sensor is used internally to correct the temperature dependency of calibration parameters of the accelerometer and gyroscope. The temperature compensation is optimal in the range of -40°C to +85°C with a resolution of 0.0625°C (1/16 °C) or inversely, 16 LSB/°C.

The QMI8658A outputs the internal chip temperature that the HOST can read. The output is 16 bits, with a (1/256)°C per LSB resolution. To read the temperature, the HOST needs to access the TEMP register (see TEMP_L and TEMP_H in Data Output Registers in Table 25).

The calculation formula is:

T = TEMP_H + (TEMP_L / 256)

To read the temperature sensor data properly, the Host is expected to follow the guidelines in 13 Locking Mechanism.

**Table 18. Temperature Sensor Specifications**
| Subsystem | Parameter | Typical | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Digital Temperature Sensor | Range | -40 to +85 | °C |
| | Internal Resolution | 16 | Bits |
| | Internal Sensitivity | 256 | LSB/°C |
| | Output Register Width | 16 | Bits |
| | Output Sensitivity | 256 | LSB/°C |

4 Register Map Overview
The QMI8658A UI registers enable programming and control of the inertial measurement unit and associated on-chip
signal processing. These registers are accessed through the UI interface – either SPI (4 wires or 3 wires) I3C, or I2C.

4.1 UI Register Map Overview

UI register map may be classified into the following register categories:
▪ Chip Information Registers
▪ Setup and Control Registers: control various aspects of the IMU.
▪ Host Controlled Calibration Registers: control and configure various aspects of the IMU via the host command
interface called CTRL9
▪ Count Register for time stamping the sensor samples
▪ Sensor data registers
▪ FIFO Registers: to set up the FIFO and detect data availability and over-run
▪ Activity Detection status registers
▪ General Purpose Registers

5.10 CTRL 9 Functionality (Executing Pre-defined Commands)

5.10.1 CTRL9 Protocol Description
The protocol for executing predefined commands from an external host processor on the QMI8658A is facilitated by
using the CTRL9 register. The register is available to the host via the UI SPI/I2C/I3C bus.

It operates by the host writing a pre-defined value (Command, refer to 5.10.2 CTRL9 Command List) to the CTRL9
register. The firmware of the QMI8658A evaluates this command and if a match is found it executes the corresponding
pre-defined function.

Once the function has been executed, the QMI8658A signals the completion by setting STATUSINT.bit7 to 1, and
raising INT1 interrupt if CTRL1.bit3 = 1 & CTRL8.bit7 == 0. The host must acknowledge this by writing
CTRL_CMD_ACK (0x00) to CTRL9 register. After receiving the CTRL_CMD_ACK command, the QMI8658A clears the
STATUSINT.bit7 to 0 and pulls down the INT1 interrupt if CTRL1.bit3 = 1 & CTRL8.bit7 == 0.

This command presentation from the host to the QMI8658A and the subsequent execution and handshake between
the host and the QMI8658A will be referred to as the “CTRL9 Protocol”.

There are three types of interactions between the host and QMI8658A that follow the CTRL9 Protocol.

WCtrl9: The host needs to supply data to QMI8658A prior to the Ctrl9 protocol. (Write – Ctrl9 Protocol)

Ctrl9R: The host gets data from QMI8658A following the Ctrl9 protocol. (Ctrl9 protocol – Read)

Ctrl9: No data transaction is required prior to or following the Ctrl9 protocol. (Ctrl9).

5.10.4 WCtrl9 (Write – CTRL9 Protocol)
1. The host needs to provide the required data for this command to the QMI8658A. The host typically does this by
placing the data in a set of registers called the CAL registers. Maximum eight CAL registers are used. Refer to
Table 29.
2. Write Ctrl9 register 0x0A with the appropriate Command value, refer to Table 28.
3. The Device will set STATUSINT.bit7 to 1, and raise INT1(if CTRL1.bit3 = 1 & CTRL8.bit7 == 0), once it has
executed the appropriate function based on the command value.
4. The host must acknowledge this by writing CTRL_CMD_ACK (0x00) to CTRL9 register, STATUSINT.bit7
(CmdDone) will be reset to 0 on receiving the CTRL_CMD_ACK command. And INT1 is pulled low upon the
register read if CTRL1.bit3 = 1 & CTRL8.bit7 == 0.
5. If any data is expected from the device, it will be available at this time. The location of the data is specified
separately for each of the Commands.
Refer to 5.10.6 for details.

5.10.5 Ctrl9R (CTRL9 Protocol - Read)
1. Write Ctrl9 register 0x0A with the appropriate Command value.
2. The Device will set STATUSINT.bit7 to 1, and raise INT1 (if CTRL1.bit3 = 1 & CTRL8.bit7 == 0), once it has
executed the appropriate function based on the command value.
3. The host must acknowledge this by writing CTRL_CMD_ACK (0x00) to CTRL9 register, STATUSINT.bit7
(CmdDone) will be reset to 0 on receiving the CTRL_CMD_ACK command. INT1 is pulled low upon the register
read if CTRL1.bit3 = 1 & CTRL8.bit7 == 0.
4. Data is available from the device on the CAL registers. The location of the data is specified separately for each of
the Commands.
Refer to 5.10.6 for details.

5.10.6 CTRL9 Commands in Details

5.10.6.1 CTRL_CMD_ACK

Host acknowledges QMI8658A when received the CmdDone information, to end the CTRL9 protocol.

5.10.6.2 CTRL_CMD_RST_FIFO

This CTRL9 command of writing 0x04 to the Ctrl9 register 0x0a allows the host to instruct the device to reset the FIFO.
The FIFO data, sample count and flags will be cleared and reset to default status.

5.10.6.3 CTRL_CMD_REQ_FIFO

This CTRL9 Command is issued when the host wants to get data from the FIFO, by writing 0x05 through the CTRL9
process.

After successfully finish the CTRL9 process, the FIFO read mode will be enabled, the device will direct the FIFO data
to the FIFO_DATA register(0x17) until the FIFO is empty. After reading the FIFO data, host must set
FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_rd_mode to 0 by write the FIFO_CTRL register, which will cause the
FIFO_STATUS.FIFO_WTM/FIFO_FULL to be cleared and/or the INT pin (if enabled) be de-asserted. Refer to 错误!未
找到引用源。错误!未找到引用源。 for CTRL9 operation, and refer to 8.8 for details.

5.10.6.4 CTRL_CMD_WRITE_WOM_SETTING

This CTRL9 Command is issued when the host wants to enable/modify the trigger thresholds or blanking interval of the
Wake on Motion Feature of the device. Please refer to 12 Wake on Motion (WoM) for details of setting up this feature.
Once the specified CAL registers are loaded with the appropriate data, the Command is issued by writing 0x08 to
CTRL9 register 0x0A.

5.10.6.5 CTRL_CMD_ACCEL_HOST_DELTA_OFFSET

This CTRL9 Command is issued when the host wants to manually change the accelerometer offset. Each delta offset
value should contain 16 bits and the format is signed 4.12 (12 fraction bits, unit is 1 / 2^12). The user must write the
offset to the following registers:

Accel_Delta_X : {CAL1_H, CAL1_L}
Accel_Delta_Y : {CAL2_H, CAL2_L}
Accel_Delta_Z : {CAL3_H, CAL3_L}

© 2022 QST Corporation Document#: 13-52-25 ∙ QMI8658A Datasheet ∙ Rev A www. qstcorp.com
43

<!-- page: 45 -->
Next, the Command is issued by writing 0x09 to CTRL9 register 0x0A. Note, this offset change is lost when the sensor
is power cycled, or the system is reset.

5.10.6.6 CTRL_CMD_GYRO_HOST_DELTA_OFFSET

This CTRL9 Command is issued when the host wants to manually change the gyroscope offset. Each delta offset value
should contain 16 bits and the format is signed 11.5 (5 fraction bits, unit is 1 / 2^5). The user must write the offset to
the following registers:

Gyro_Delta_X : {CAL1_H, CAL1_L}
Gyro_Delta_Y : {CAL2_H, CAL2_L}
Gyro_Delta_Z : {CAL3_H, CAL3_L}

Next, the Command is issued by writing 0x0A to CTRL9 register 0x0A. Note, this offset change is lost when the sensor
is power cycled, or the system is reset.

5.10.6.7 CTRL_CMD_CONFIGURE_TAP

This CTRL9 command is issued to configure the parameters of Tap detection. Refer to 10.3 Configure Tap for details.

5.10.6.8 CTRL_CMD_CONFIGURE_PEDOMETER

This CTRL9 command is issued to configure the parameters of Pedometer detection. Refer to 11.2 Configure
Pedometer for details.

5.10.6.9 CTRL_CMD_CONFIGURE_MOTION

This CTRL9 command is issued to configure the parameters of Motion Detection. Refer to 9.4 Config Motion Detection.

5.10.6.10 CTRL_CMD_RESET_PEDOMETER

This CTRL9 command is issued to clear the step count of Pedometer. Refer to 11.6 Reset Step Count for details.

5.10.6.11 CTRL_CMD_COPY_USID

The USID is the unique ID of every single QMI8658A part.
This CTRL9 Command copies the following data into UI registers. It is initiated by the host writing 0x10 to CTRL9. After
issuing the command, the data will be available for the host to read from the registers shown below:

FW_Version byte 0 → dQW_L
FW_Version byte 1 → dQW_H
FW_Version byte 2 → dQX_L
USID_Byte_0 → dVX_L
USID_Byte_1 → dVX_H
USID_Byte_2 → dVY_L
USID_Byte_3 → dVY_H
USID_Byte_4 → dVZ_L
USID_Byte_5 → dVZ_H
Note that after the successful Power-On Reset or Soft-Reset, the FW_Version and USID will be copied automatically
to the according registers once for host to read them. Those registers can be changed after enabling the sensors, so
afterwards, the CTRL_CMD_COPY_USID command should be implemented to copy the FW_Version and USID to the
according registers before reading.

5.10.6.12 CTRL_CMD_SET_RPU

This CTRL9 Command is issued when the host configure the IO pull-up resistors. Each bit controls a combination of
resistors as shown in Table 30:

6 Interrupts
The QMI8658A has two Interrupt lines, INT1 and INT2.

Both INT1 and INT2 can be configured as High-Z mode or Push-Pull mode by configure the CTRL1.bit3(INT1) or
CTRL1.bit4(INT2). If CTRL1.bit3 (CTRL1.bit4) is set to 0, INT1(INT2) will be set in High-Z mode accordingly. While if
CTRL1.bit3 (CTRL1.bit4) is set to 1, INT1(INT2) will be set in Push-Pull mode accordingly. By default, INT1 and INT2
are in High-Z mode.

If QMI8658A is configured in Wake on Motion (WoM) mode, there is no sensor data generated. The INT pins
behavior follows the configuration of WoM, refer to 12 Wake on Motion (WoM).

If QMI8658A is not in Wake on Motion mode, there are two modes of the interrupt map, as described below. Host can
config multiple internal signal/interrupt sources to INT pins (INT1 and/or INT2). If driven to one INT pin, the multiple
sources act in LOGIC-OR.

6.1 SyncSample mode

The SyncSample mode supports locking the values during reading process. Refer to 13 Locking Mechanism.
For details to the sensor data registers.
.

Set CTRL7.bit7(SyncSample) == 1 will enable the SyncSample mode.

As illustrated in Figure 14. In SyncSample mode, the CTRL9 handshake signal will be routed to INT1. Check 5.10 for
details.

The motion event interrupts (Any Motion, No Motion, Significant Motion, Pedometer, Tap) will be routed to INT1 if
enabled.

FIFO function is not supported in this mode, and DRDY signal will be routed to INT2.

46

<!-- page: 48 -->
6.2 Non-SyncSample mode

This mode supports FIFO function and free interrupts configuration, as illustrated in Figure 15.

If CTRL7.bit7(SyncSample) == 0, then bit 1 of STATUSINT register will have the same value as INT1 and bit 0 of STATUSINT register will have the same value as INT2.

In Non-SyncSample mode, there are two approaches of CTRL9 handshake. Host can check the INT1 pin high level for the handshark if set CTRL8.bit7 = 0; or poll the STATUSINT.bit7 for handshake if set CTRL8.bit7 = 1.

In Non-SyncSample mode, the motion event interrupt(s) can be configured to INT1 by setting CTRL8.bit6 = 1, or to INT2 by setting CTRL8.bit6 = 0. Note that the motion event engines can be enabled by CTRL8.bit[4:0], refer to Table 22 for details.

In Non-SycnSample mode, the sensor data can be output through data register or FIFO. Configure the FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_MODE = 'bypass' mode, will enable the DRDY function and disable FIFO functionality; configure the FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_MODE = other mode, will enable the FIFO functionality and disable the DRDY function.

If FIFO mode is enabled, the FIFO interrupt can be configured to INT1 pin if CTRL1.bit2 is set to 1, or INT2 pin if CTRL1.bit2 is set to 0. Refer to 8 FIFO Description for more details of FIFO interrupt behavior.

If DRDY mode is enabled, the DRDY signal will be routed to INT2 if the CTRL7.bit5(DRDY_DIS) is set to 0, or be blocked from INT2 pin if CTRL7.bit5(DRDY_DIS) is set to 1.

Figure 15. Interrupt Map of Non-SyncSample Mode

6.3 DRDY(Data Ready)

If DRDY mode is enabled (accelerometer and/or gyroscope are/is enabled, and FIFO mode is set to bypass) and DRDY_DIS == 0, DRDY (Data Ready) signal will be driven to the INT2 in edge-trigger mode, means the DRDY signal can be seen on INT2. The Sensor Data Output Registers(refer to 5.6) are updated at the Output Data Rate (ODR), and DRDY signal is pulsed at the ODR frequency. The new data is updated to the data registers during the low level before the rising edge, and a rising edge on DRDY indicates that data is available for host to read. DRDY is cleared automatically after a short duration. The DRDY pulse width is dependent on the sensor ODR set by CTRL2 and/or CTRL3 registers and enabled sensor(s).

In Non-SyncSample mode, it is the responsibility of the host to detect the rising edge and to read the data out during
the high level of the INT2 pulse. Otherwise, there is the possibility that the updating of the new data happens during
the host reading process and causes data mismatch.

In SyncSample mode, it is possible to lock the data in the data registers and read them in an unlimited delay, by
following a process. Refer to 6.1 SyncSample mode.

7 Operating Modes
The QMI8658A offers a large number of operating modes that may be used to operate the device in a power efficient
manner. These modes are described in Table 31 and are shown in Figure 16; they may be configured using the control
(CTRL) registers.
7.1 Operating Modes Descriptions

Table 31. Operating Modes

Mode Description Suggested Configuration

All sensors off, clock is turned on. The current in this mode CTRL1 sensorDisable = 0
Power-On Default is typically 15 µA. Note this mode is the default state upon CTRL7 aEN = 0, gEN = 0,

7.2 General Mode Transitioning

Upon exiting the No Power state (i.e. on first applying power to the part) or exiting a Software Reset state, the part will
enter the Power-On Default state. From there, the sensor can be configured in the various modes described in Table
31 and as shown in Figure 16. The figure illustrates the timing associated with various mode transitions, and values for
these times are given in the section below and in Table 7 and Table 8.

7.3 Transition Time

t0 is the System Turn On Time and is the time to enter the Power-On Default state from Software Reset, No Power, or
Power down. Time t0 is maximum 15ms. This time only needs to be done once, upon transitioning from either a No
Power or Power Down state, or whenever a reset is issued, which should not be done unless the intent is to have the
device to go through its entire boot sequence (see the specification System Turn On Time in both Table 7 and Table
8).

The times t1, t2 and t4, are defined as the time it takes from issuing the enabling-sensor command (when the
corresponding sensor is off) to DRDY(INT2) going high (data being present) or STATUSINT.bit0 is set to 1.

The time t5 is the time it takes to have the internal filtered data to output the correct representation of the inertial state.
t5 is variable and is associated with the user selected Output Data Rate (ODR). We have defined minimum t5 = (3/ODR)
to generally represent that time.

t6 is the time it takes to go from a sensor powered state to a state where the sensors are off. This time depends on the
Output Data Rate (ODR) and ranges from 1/ODR to 2/ODR.

<!-- page: 52 -->
t7 is the transition time between various states where the sensors are off.

The Gyro Turn on Time (see Table 8) is comprised of t1 (the gyroscope wakeup time) and t5 (the part’s filter settling
time). t1 is typically 150 ms and t5 is defined as 3/ODR, where ODR is the output data rate in Hertz.

The Accel Turn on Time (see Table 7) is comprised of t2 (the accelerometer wakeup time) and t5 (the part’s filter
settling time). t2 is typically 3 ms, and t5 is defined as 3/ODR, where ODR is the output data rate in Hertz.

The t7 transition is dependent on data transfer rates and is for I2C at 400 kHz is <100 µs for SPI at 11 Mbps is around
40 µs.

7.4 Chip Reset Process

There are two approaches that can trigger the QMI8658A run the Reset process, Power-On Reset and Software Reset.

Power-On reset is initialized by driving the VDD & VDDIO lines to valid working range from the Power Off status (VDD
= 0V, VDDIO = 0V). Refer to 3.2 for details. The Power-On Reset process starts from the release of POR, refer to 3.3
for details.

The Software Reset (Soft Reset) is generated by writing the 0x0B to RESET register (0x60). Refer to 5.9.

After the Reset is triggered (Power-On Reset and Software Reset), the QMI8658 will run the reset process. The UI
registers, internal RAM, FIFO will be set to default values, Analog and digital circuitries will be disabled, refer to 3.3 for
details.

It takes maximum 15ms for the Reset process to be finished. Refer to Table 7 and Table 8 for details. Note that the
VDDIO & VDD power lines are expected to be stable(no sharp pulse) once settled to the Final Value(s), before the
System Turn On Time. Otherwise, the QMI8658A initialization may be interfered by the unwanted power pulse, and
result in failure of accelerometer or gyroscope startup, refer to 3.3 for details.

The register 0x4D will present 0x80 if there is a successful Reset (Power-on Reset or Soft Reset) process. Refer to
5.9. Note that the content of register 0x4D could be overwritten after later operations, like enabling the sensor(s) (in
CTRL7.bit[1:0]) or implementing the CTRL9 command, so host is expected to read the register immediately after POR
or Software Reset to check the Reset result.

8 FIFO Description
8.1 FIFO Structure

The QMI8658A contains a programmable 1536-byte FIFO. The FIFO’s operating mode and configuration are set via
the FIFO_CTRL register, refer to Table 23. FIFO data may consist of gyroscope and accelerometer data and is
accessible via the serial interfaces (SPI/I2C/I3C), in burst reads. Depending on how many sensors are enabled, the
host is expected to read increments of 6, 12 bytes, corresponding to one and two sensors active at the same time. This
feature helps reduce overall system power consumption by enabling the host processor to read and process the sensor
data in bursts and then enter a low-power mode. The interrupt function may be used to alert host when FIFO watermark
level is reached.

Figure 17. FIFO Data Flow
8.2 FIFO Size

There are four levels of FIFO size: 16 samples, 32 samples, 64 samples, 128 samples. The sample stands for 6 bytes
of accelerometer data or 6 bytes of gyroscope data if one of them is enabled, or 6 bytes of accelerometer and 6 bytes
of gyroscope data (total 12 bytes) if both are enabled.

The FIFO size is configured using the FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_SIZE[1:0]: 16 samples(0), 32 samples(1), 64 samples(2), 128
samples(3), refer to Table 23.

When the FIFO is enabled for two sensors (Accelerometer and Gyroscope), the sensors must be set at the same
Output Data Rate (ODR), refer to Table 22 for CTRL2 and CTRL3 registers.
8.3 Configure FIFO Mode

The FIFO has multiple operating modes: Bypass, FIFO, Stream. The operating modes are set by the
FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_MDOE[1:0] bits in the register, refer to Table 23.

Configure the FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_MODE to ‘FIFO’(1) or ‘Stream’(2) mode will enable the FIFO functionality. Configure
the FIFO_MODE to ‘Bypass’ (0) mode, will disable the FIFO functionality.

Once FIFO is enabled and the Accelerometer and/or Gyroscope is(are) enabled, the corresponding data will be filled
into FIFO.

In ‘FIFO’ mode, once FIFO is full, the data filling will stop and new data will be discarded until host reads out the FIFO
data and release the space for new data to be written to.

In ‘Stream’ mode, once FIFO is full, the data filling will continue and the oldest data will be discarded, until host reads
out the FIFO data and release the space for new data to be written to.

<!-- page: 54 -->
8.4 FIFO Sample Count

The FIFO Sample Count indicates the filled content level of FIFO, which means the quantity of sensor data that was
written into FIFO, and to be read out.

The FIFO Sample Count is a 10-bit value and stored in FIFO_SMPL_CNT and FIFO_STATUS[1:0], unit is word(two
bytes). Host need to read the two registers, to calculate the number of bytes of FIFO content data by below formular:

FIFO_Sample_Count (in byte) = 2 * (fifo_smpl_cnt_msb[1:0] * 256 + fifo_smpl_cnt_lsb[7:0])

8.5 FIFO Watermark Interrupt

The FIFO_WTM register(0x13) indicates the expected level of FIFO data that host wants to get the FIFO Watermark
interrupt. The unit is sample, which means 6 bytes if one of accelerometer and gyroscope is enabled, and 12 bytes if
both are enabled.

Note that the configured FIFO watermark should not be higher than the FIFO size configured by
FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_SIZE.

If the FIFO_WTM is written with non-zero value, the FIFO watermark function is enabled. The internal FIFO watermark
interrupt will be triggered if the FIFO content level reaches or is higher than the configured FIFO watermark level. The
FIFO_STATUS.FIFO_WTM flag will be set to 1, and will be cleared to 0 if FIFO content drops lower than the FIFO
watermark level.

The internal FIFO watermark interrupt signal can drive the INT1 pin if CTRL1.bit2 = 1, or INT2 pin if CTRL1.bit2 = 0.
Note that the CTRL1.bit3(INT1) and CTRL1.bit4(INT2) controls the high-Z or push-pull mode of the INT pins, refer to 6
Interrupts for details.

Once the corresponds INT pin is configured to the push-pull mode, the FIFO watermark interrupt can be seen on the
corresponds INT pin. It will keep high level as long as the FIFO filled level is equal to or higher than the watermark, will
drop to low level as long as the FIFO filled level is lower than the configured FIFO watermark after reading out by host
and FIFO_RD_MODE is cleared.

8.6 FIFO Full

The FIFO_STATUS.FIFO_FULL flag is set if the FIFO filled level (samples) equals to the FIFO size configured by
FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_SIZE. And is cleared if FIFO filled level is lower than the FIFO size.

8.7 FIFO Read Mode

To read out the FIFO data, host need to set the FIFO into Read Mode, by issuing CTRL_CMD_REQ_FIFO command
through CTRL9 process, refer to 5.10 CTRL 9 Functionality (Executing Pre-defined Commands).

Once FIFO Read Mode is enabled, FIFO data will be directed to the FIFO_DATA register, then host can possibly read
data from the FIFO_DATA register.

Note that once FIFO Read Mode is enabled, the new data won’t be filled into FIFO, and will be discarded. Host is
expected to read out the FIFO data and disable the FIFO Read Mode before the new data come. Otherwise, data
dropping will happen. The time for the new data come is defined by the sensor ODR, which is 1 / ODR.

8.8 Read FIFO Data

The FIFO data is read through the I2C/I3C/SPI interface by reading the FIFO_DATA register. Any time the FIFO_DATA
register is read, data is erased from the FIFO memory, corresponds to First-In-First-Out concept.

Host is expected to read out the FIFO data, following below sequence:

1. Got FIFO watermark interrupt by INT pin or polling the FIFO_STATUS register (FIFO_WTM and/or FIFO_FULL).

2. Read the FIFO_SMPL_CNT and FIFO_STATUS registers, to calculate the level of FIFO content data, refer to 8.4
FIFO Sample Count.

3. Send CTRL_CMD_REQ_FIFO (0x05) by CTRL9 command, to enable FIFO read mode. Refer to
CTRL_CMD_REQ_FIFO for details.

4. Read from the FIFO_DATA register per FIFO_Sample_Count.

5. Disable the FIFO Read Mode by setting FIFO_CTRL.FIFO_rd_mode to 0. New data will be filled into FIFO
afterwards.

8.9 FIFO Data Pattern

Note that when only the accelerometer or gyroscope is enabled, the sensor data format at the host interface is:

AX_L[0]AX_H[0]AY_L[0]AY_H[0]AZ_L[0]AZ_H[0]AX_L[1]…

or

GX_L[0]GX_H[0]GY_L[0]GY_H[0]GZ_L[0]GZ_H[0]GX_L[1]…

When both accelerometer and gyroscope are enabled, the sensor data format is:

AX_L[0]AX_H[0]AY_L[0]AY_H[0]AZ_L[0]AZ_H[0]

GX_L[0]GX_H[0]GY_L[0]GY_H[0]GZ_L[0]GZ_H[0]

AX_L[1]AX_H[1]…

8.10 Reset FIFO

The FIFO content can be cleared/emptied by inserting CTRL_CMD_RST_FIFO through CTRL9 process, refer to 5.10
CTRL 9 Functionality (Executing Pre-defined Commands) for details.

Significant-Motion Detection works based on Any-Motion and No-Motion events, so both Any-Motion and No-Motion
should be configured and enabled to make sure Significant-Motion Detection run properly. As shown in Figure 20.

After valid Any-Motion is detected, if a further Any-Motion is detected after SigMotionWaitWindow and before the
SigMotionConfirmWindow time, the Significant-Motion event flag will be raised to the interrupt path. The Significant-
Motion interrupt is cleared when No-Motion is detected.

9.4 Config Motion Detection

The Motion Detection parameters are divided into two sets and can be passed to the QMI8658A internal algorithm
through two callings of CTRL9 command. As shown in Table 34.

Host should write the parameters to the corresponding registers, according to Table 34. Especially, write 0x01 to
CAL4_H register for the first set of parameters, while write 0x02 to CAL4_H for the second set of parameters. Refer to
Table 29 for address of CAL registers.

Then trigger the CTRL9 command with 0x0E(CTRL_CMD_CONFIGURE_MOTION). Refer to Table 28 for details.

Note: Configuration should be done when accelerometer and gyroscope are disabled(CTRL7.aEN = CTRL7.gEN =0).
9.5 Enabling Motion Detection

After successfully passing the parameters to QMI8658A Motion Detection engine, host need to enable the Any-Motion
Detection engine by setting CTRL8.bit1 to 1, enable the No-Motion Detection engine by setting CTRL8.bit2 to 1, enable
the Significant-Motion Detection engine by setting CTRL8.bit3 to 1. If the accelerometer is configured and enabled too,
the enabled engines will be started to detect the corresponding events.

On contrary, set the bit(s) in CTRL8.bit[3:1] to 0, will disable the corresponding engine. This can be done when
accelerometer and/or gyroscope are(is) enabled or disabled. Refer to 5.3 Configuration Registers for the details of
CTRL8.
9.6 Motion Interrupt

Once the Any-Motion, No-Motion and/or Significant-Motion event(s) is/are reported, the corresponding Motion
Detection Event will be generated.

The Motion Event (internal signal) can be selected to drive INT1(CTRL8.bit6 = 1) or INT2(CTRL8.bit6 = 0). And once
the corresponding INT pin is enabled (by CTRL1.bit3 for INT1, or CTRL1.bit4 for INT2), the Motion interrupt can be
seen on the INT pin (synced with DRDY). Refer to 5.3 Configuration Registers for details.

At the meantime, the STATUS1.bit[7:5] is updated and host can read these bits to confirm the Motion interrupt status.
Note that the STATUS1.bit[5] = 1 represents the Any-Motion was detected, STATUS1.bit[6] = 1 represents the No-
Motion was detected, STATUS1.bit[7] = 1 represents the Significant-Motion was detected. Refer to 5.3 Configuration
Registers for details.

10.3 Configure Tap

The Tap parameters are divided into two sets and can be passed to the QMI8658A internal algorithm through two
callings of CTRL9 command. As shown in Table 36.

Host should write the parameters to the corresponding registers, according to Table 36. Especially, write 0x01 to
CAL4_H register for the first set of parameters, while write 0x02 to CAL4_H for the second set of parameters. Refer to
Table 29 for address of CAL registers.

Then trigger the CTRL9 comment with 0x0C(CTRL_CMD_CONFIGURE_TAP). Refer to 5.10 for details.

CTRL9 code 0x0C(CTRL_CMD_CONFIGURE_TAP) 0x0C(CTRL_CMD_CONFIGURE_TAP)

Note: Configuration should be done when accelerometer and gyroscope are disabled(CTRL7.aEN = CTRL7.gEN =0).

10.4 Enable Tap Detection

After successfully passing the parameters to QMI8658A Tap engine, host need to enable the Tap engine by setting
CTRL8.bit0 to 1. If the accelerometer is properly configured and enabled (CTRL7.aEN = 1), Tap engine will be started
to detect the taps. To detecting the Tap activity, it is recommended to set accelerometer ODR to higher than 200Hz
(defined by CTRL2.aODR).

If CTRL8.bit0 is set to 0, or CTRL7.aEN = 0, Tap engine will be stopped to detect the taps.
10.5 Tap Interrupt

Once the Tap event is reported (Single- or Double-Tap), it can generate the Tap interrupt.

The Tap event (internal signal) can be selected to drive INT1(CTRL8.bit6 = 1) or INT2(CTRL8.bit6 = 0). And once the
corresponding INT pin is enabled (by CTRL1.bit3 for INT1, or CTRL1.bit4 for INT2), the Tap interrupt will be seen on
the INT pin (synced with DRDY). Refer to to 5.3 Configuration Registers for details.

At the meantime, the STATUS1.bit1 is set and host can read this bit to confirm the Tap (Single- or Double-Tap) interrupt
is generated.
10.6 Tap Detection Output

When the Tap (Single- or Double-Tap) is detected, the information of the Tap is presented in TAP_STATUS (register
0x59). The TAP_STATUS is updated and valid after the Tap event is detected (STATUSINT.bit1 = 1).

The TAP_NUM indicate the Single-Tap (TAP_STATUS.TAP_NUM = 1) or Double-Tap (TAP_STATUS.TAP_NUM = 2)
was detected.

The TAP_STATUS.TAP_AXIS indicates the first valid peak of the Tap happens on X axis (TAP_STATUS.TAP_AXIS
= 1), or Y axis (TAP_STATUS.TAP_AXIS = 2), or Z axis (TAP_STATUS.TAP_AXIS = 3). Note the TAP_AXIS
judgement follows the definition of the Tap Priority. Refer to Table 35 for details.

11 Pedometer
The Pedometer Engine detects the steps and output the step count to the UI registers for host to read, as well as
generate the Pedometer interrupt.

The calculation of the Pedometer Detection is based on the accelerometer ODR defined by CTRL2.aODR, refer to
Table 22 for details.

The Pedometer can only work in Non-SyncSample mode, refer to 6.2 Non-SyncSample mode for details.

11.1 Pedometer Parameters

The parameters listed in Table 37 are used to configure the Pedometer Engine.

Table 37. Pedometer Parameters

Parameter Name Format Resolution Description
Indicates the count of sample batch/window for
ped_sample_cnt 2-bytes integer 1 sample

2-bytes format Indicates the threshold of the valid peak-to-peak
(1 / 2^10) g
ped_fix_peak2peak unsigned, detection
= 1 mg
10-bits fraction E.g., 0x00CC means 200mg

2-bytes format Indicates the threshold of the peak detection comparing
ped_fix_peak unsigned, 1 mg to average
10-bits fraction E.g., 0x0066 means 100mg

Indicates the maximum duration (timeout window) for a
step. Reset counting calculation if no peaks detected
ped_time_up 2-bytes integer 1 sample within this duration.

E.g., 80 means 1.6s @ ODR = 50Hz

Indicates the minimum duration for a step. The peaks
ped_time_low 1-byte integer 1 sample detected within this duration (quiet time) is ignored.
E.g., 12 means 0.25s @ ODR = 50Hz

Indicates the minimum continuous steps to start the valid
step counting. If the continuously detected steps is lower
than this count and timeout, the steps will not be take
into account; if yes, the detected steps will all be taken
into account and counting is started to count every
ped_time_cnt_entry 1-byte integer 1 step following step before timeout. This is useful to screen out
the fake steps detected by non-step vibrations.

The timeout duration is defined by ped_time_up.

E.g., 10 means 10 steps entry count

ped_fix_precision 1-byte integer 1 sample 0 is recommended

The amount of steps when to update the pedometer
output registers.
ped_sig_count 1-byte integer 1 sample
E.g., ped_sig_count = 4, every 4 valid steps is detected,
update the registers once (added by 4).

In the example of parameters listed below, the calculation window is 50 samples (1s duration);

The slowest step that can be detected is 4s (0.25 step per 1 second); the fastest step that can be detected is 0.4s (2.5
steps per 1 second).

The steps detected lower than 10 and timeout (defined by ped_time_up), will be ignored. The step counting starts if 10
continues steps detected (internal steps: 10, 11, 12, ...), while the step count registers is updated with 10, 14, 18…
(update once after every 4 steps detected).

It is recommended to select the proper ped_fix_peak2peak and ped_fix_peak values depend on the movement
amplitude and movement pattern, for example, if places QMI8658A in a watch or bend, running normally shows more
significant peaks than walking.

ODR = 50Hz

ped_sample_cnt: 50 samples (0x0032)

ped_fix_peak2peak: 200mg (0x00CC in u6.10 format)

11.2 Configure Pedometer

The Pedometer parameters are divided into two sets and can be passed to the QMI8658A internal algorithm through
two callings of CTRL9 command. As shown in Table 38.

Host should write the parameters to the corresponding registers, according to Table 38. Especially, write 0x01 to
CAL4_H register for the first CTRL9 command of parameters, while write 0x02 to CAL4_H for the second CTRL9
command of parameters. Then trigger the CTRL9 command with 0x0D(CTRL_CMD_CONFIGURE_PEDOMETER).
Refer to Table 28 for details.

11.3 Enable Pedometer

After successfully passed the parameters to QMI8658 Pedometer engine, host need to enable the Pedometer engine
by setting CTRL8.bit4 to 1. If the accelerometer is enabled (CTRL7.aEN = 1), the Pedometer engine will start to detect
the steps.

If CTRL8.bit4 is set to 0, or CTRL7.aEN = 0, Pedometer engine will stop to detect the steps.

<!-- page: 67 -->
11.4 Pedometer Interrupt

Once the detected steps (count from last pedometer event) reach the ped_sig_count defined by host, it will generate
the Pedometer interrupt once. For example, if ped_sig_count = 4, then every 4 valid steps detected, there is one
Pedometer interrupt (internal signal).

At the meantime, the STATUS1.bit4 is set and host can read this bit to confirm Pedometer event is detected.

The Pedometer interrupt(internal signal) can be selected to drive INT1(CTRL8.bit6 = 1) or INT2(CTRL8.bit6 = 0). And
once the corresponding INT pin is enabled(by CTRL1.bit3 for INT1, or CTRL1.bit4 for INT2), the Pedometer interrupt
will be seen on the INT pin(synced with DRDY). Refer to to 5.3 Configuration Registers for details.
11.5 Read Step Count

When the Pedometer is enabled, and the Pedometer event is detected (STATUS1.bit4 = 1), the step count is updated
to the Step Count registers of STEP_CNT_LOW, STEP_CNT_MIDL, STEP_CNT_HIGH, in 24-bits value. Note that the
step count is updated per the ped_sig_count definition. For example, if ped_sig_count = 4, the step count is be updated
every 4 steps. The 24-bits step count is cycling counted, will return to 0 after 0xFFFFFF.

Host can read from the three registers, to get the latest step count.
11.6 Reset Step Count

The Step Count can be reset by issuing Power-On Reset, Soft Reset, setting CTRL8.bit4 to 1 from 0, and CTRL9
command (CTRL_CMD_RESET_PEDOMETER).

After reset the Step Count registers (STEP_CNT_LOW, STEP_CNT_MIDL, STEP_CNT_HIGH) are cleared to 0.

When CTRL8.bit4 (Pedo_EN) = 0, set CTRL8.bit4 to 1 will reset the Setp Count registers. Host can simply clear the
CTRL8.bit4 and then set it to restart the Pedometer engine and reset the Step Count registers. Refer to Table 22 for
CTRL8 register.

Send 0x0F (CTRL_CMD_RESET_PEDOMETER) by CTRL9 command protocol will reset the Step Count without reset
the QMI8658A. Refer to Table 28 for CTRL9 operation.

Note that enalbe and/or disable the accelerometer by configure CTRL7.bit1(aEN), will not influence the content of the
Step Counter registers.

12 Wake on Motion (WoM)
12.1 Wake on Motion Principle

The purpose of the Wake on Motion (WoM) functionality is to allow a system to enter a low power sleep state while the
system is static and then to automatically awaken when moved. In this mode the system should use very little power,
yet still respond quickly to motion.

It is assumed that the system host processor is responsible for configuring the QMI8658A correctly to place it into Wake
on Motion mode, and then reconfigure the QMI8658A as necessary following a WoM interrupt.

Note that, Wake on Motion function works similar to Any-Motion detection but without sensor data output and can be
configure more flexibly on interrupt behavior. Besides, once QMI8658A is configured into Wake on Motion mode, there
is WoM interrupt to awaken the host if movement is detected.
12.2 Wake on Motion Parameters

Wake on Motion is configured through the CTRL9 command interface (refer to Table 28 for details for
CTRL_CMD_WRITE_WOM_SETTING ).

Table 39. Registers used for WoM

Register Format Resolution
Function
(bits)

1-byte unsigned 1mg WoM Threshold:
CAL1_L[7:0] integer Indicate the threshold of absolute of slope of a valid movement
0x00 must be used to indicate that WoM mode is disabled
2-bits unsigned 1 WoM Interrupt Initial Value select:
integer 01 – INT2 (with initial value 0)
CAL1_H[7:6] 11 – INT2 (with initial value 1)
00 – INT1 (with initial value 0)
10 – INT1 (with initial value 1)

6-bits unsigned 1 Interrupt Blanking Time (in number of accelerometer samples), the
CAL1_H[5:0] integer number of consecutive samples that will be ignored after enabling the
WoM, to screen out unwanted fake detection
1-byte unsigned 1 CTRL_CMD_WRITE_WOM_SETTING (0x08): to send this pre-
CTRL9[7:0]
integer defined command to QMI8658A to enable the WoM mode

The WoM Threshold value is configurable to make the amount of motion required to wake QMI8658A and the host.
The special threshold value of 0x00 can be used to disable the WoM mode, returning the interrupt pins to their normal
functionality. Refer to 6 Interrupts.

The Interrupt Initial Value (1 or 0) and the interrupt pin used for signaling (INT1 or INT2) are selectable to make it easy
for system integrators to use the WoM motion mode to wake the host processor from its deepest sleep level. The
selected INT pin can be configured as High-active or Low-active, if enabled by CTRL1.bit3 for INT1, or CTRL1.bit4 for
INT2, the WoM interrupt can be seen on the INT pin and interrupt host.

The Interrupt Blanking Time is a programmable number of accelerometer samples to ignore when starting WoM mode
so that no spurious wake-up events are generated by startup transients.
12.3 Accelerometer Configuration

Host is expected to configure the proper ODR and full-scale range of accelerometer by configure CTRL2 register. Refer
to Table 22.

12.4 Wake on Motion Event

When a Wake on Motion event is detected the QMI8658A will set STATUS1.WoM = 1 (bit2). Reading STATUS1 by the
host will clear the WoM bit and will reset the chosen interrupt line (INT1 or INT2) to the value given by the WoM Interrupt
initial value (refer to 12.2).

For each WoM event, the state of the selected interrupt line is toggled. This ensures that while the system is moved,
the host processor will receive wakeup interrupts regardless of whether it uses high, low, positive- or negative-edge
interrupts.

67

<!-- page: 69 -->
The QMI8658A stays in WoM mode until commanded to enter a new mode by the host processor.

12.5 Configuration Procedure

To configure QMI8658A into WoM mode, the sequence ilustated in Figure 25 should be followed and implemented.

Figure 25. WoM Configuration Commands and Sequence

The STATUS1.WoM bit is cleared upon setting the WoM threshold to a non-zero value, and the selected interrupt pin is configured according to the settings. The interrupt blanking time is included that prevents spurious interrupts to propagate after the enabling of WoM.

12.6 Exit Wake on Motion Mode

To exit WoM mode the host must first clear CTRL7[1:0] to disable all sensors, and then write a threshold value of 0x0 for the WoM Threshold (see Table 39, Registers used for WoM) and execute the WoM configuration CTRL9 command (refer to Table 28 for details for CTRL_CMD_WRITE_WOM_SETTING). On doing this the interrupt pins will return to their normal function. After zeroing the WoM Threshold the host processor can proceed to reconfigure the QMI8658A as normal.

13 Locking Mechanism
13.1 Locking Mechanism Principle

Locking Mechanism function is enabled in SyncSample mode, can lock the sensor data and keep the values in data
registers after a proper locking process.

As the concept of “shadow register”, which enables host to read the locked data in unlimited delay without the risk of
mixing the two consecutive data if the new data comes and updates to the sensor data registers during the host read
the sensor data registers. Refer to 6.1 SyncSample mode.

13.2 Locking Mechanism Data Reading Process

Figure 27 shows the process of reading data in Locking Mechanism.

<!-- page: 71 -->
13.2.1 Disable/Enable AHB Clock Gating
First host need to disable the internal AHB clock gating, this will fully screen out the possibility of misalignment of the
two consecutive data samples. Note this is ONLY needed when using SPI (accel only mode with ODR less than 500Hz),
I2C or I3C interfaces (in all ODRs).

Host can disable the internal AHB clock gating by applying:

1- write 0x01 to CAL1_L register.

2- write 0x12 (CTRL_CMD_AHB_CLOCK_GATING) in CTRL9 protocol, refer to 5.9 and 5.10.6.13.

After disabling the sensor, enable back the clock gating by:

1- write 0x00 to CAL1_L register.

2- write 0x12 (CTRL_CMD_AHB_CLOCK_GATING) in CTRL9 protocol, refer to 5.9 and 5.10.6.13.

13.2.2 Enable Locking Mechanism
The locking Mechanism is enabled when setting CTRL7.bit7 to “1” (syncSmpl) and enable accelerometer and/or
gyroscope.

1- Enable 6DOF in this mode, write 0x83 to CTRL7.

2- Enable only Accel in this mode, write 0x81 to CTRL7.

3- Enable only Gyro in this mode, write 0x82 to CTRL7.

13.2.3 Reading Sensor Data
When the Locking Mechanism is enabled, the reading to the STATUSINT register when new sensor data is available
(STATUSINT.Avail = 1) will trigger the locking of the current sensor data sample. Once the data sample is locked, new
data will be dropped, until the release of the locking. The Locking Mechanism is automatically released after host reads
GZ_H if gyroscope is enabled or AZ_H if accelerometer only is enabled.

Process of data reading in Locking Mechanism mode:

Read STATUSINT register, if STATUSINT.Avail = 1, the locking mechanism is started to take effect, go to step 2. If
STATUSINT.Avail = 0, repeat step 1.

If STATUSINT.Avail = 1 and STATUSINT.Locked = 0, means data looking is in progress, and will be locked within
Data_Lock_Delay. If STATUSINT.Locked = 1, go to step 4.

1- Wait for Data_Lock_Delay duration (refer to 13.3), go to step 4.

Burst read the sensor data until the last byte of enabled sensor(s) (to release the locking), Refer to Table 25.

2- Repeat step 1 – 4, until Exit
13.3 Data_Lock_Delay

When the gyroscope is enabled the duration of Data_Lock_Delay is shown in Table 40.

13.4 Exit Locking Mechanism

Once pulling sensor data from QMI8658 is finished, it can be configured to exit the Locking Mechanism mode, by
disabling the sensors by setting CTRL7.bit[1:0] to 0, and enabling the AHB Clock Gating (refer to 13.2.1).

13.5 On-The-Fly ODR Change in Locking Mechanism

The on-the-fly ODR changing is supported, so host can change the ODR of sensor without disable the sensor.

An example sequence of changing ODR without disabling the sensor in locking mechanism is shown below:

1- Write CTRL2/CTRL3 to set the ODR’s of accelerometer and gyroscope and full scales.

2- Write 0x81 / 0x82 / 0x83 to CTRL7.

3- Read Sensor Data according 13.2.3.

4- Changing ODR on-the-fly:

a- Write 0x01/0x02/0x03 to CTRL7(clear the syncSmpl bit).

b- Wait 1ms.

c- Clear the Locking Mechanism in case if the data is still locked from previous ODR by reading GZ_H if gyroscope
is enabled or AZ_H if accelerometer only is enabled.

d- Write CTRL2 / CTRL3 with the new ODR’s.

e- Write 0x81/0x82/0x83 to CTRL7.

5- Start poll and read Sensor Data using the new ODRs based on 13.2.3.

Note that, the new data will be stable in at least 3 samples for filter to settle down, therefore, it is recommended to
discard the first several samples at host side.

14 Calibration-On-Demand (COD)

14.1 COD Principle

The Calibration-On-Demand supports the on-demand calibration of Gyro X and Y axes. Based the internal integrated
functionality, the QMI8658A can calibrate the internal gain of X & Y axes of gyroscope, result in a more precise
sensitivity, and a tighter distribution of the X & Y axes sensitivity over QMI8658A chips.

Note that the Z axis of gyroscope is not influenced by COD.

14.2 Run COD

To run the COD, host need to

1. Set CTRL7.aEN = 0 and CTRL7.gEN = 0, to disable the accelerometer and gyroscope.

2. Issue the CTRL_CMD_ON_DEMAND_CALIBRATION (0xA2) by CTRL9 command.

3. And wait about 1.5 seconds for QMI8658A to finish the CTRL9 command.

4. Read the COD_STATUS register (0x46) to check the result/status of the COD implementation.

During the process, it is recommended to place the device in quiet, otherwise, the COD might fail and report error.

If succeeds, the recalibrated gain parameters will be applied to the sensor data afterwards. The updated gains are
output to the UI registers and can be read by host, refer to 14.3. The recalibrated gain parameters will be lost if a power
on reset or soft reset is implemented, QMI8658A will then use the on-chip default gain parameters.

If failed, there is no influence on the operation of gyroscope, QMI8658A will keep using the previous workable
parameters (last successful COD parameters or the on-chip default parameters).

14.3 COD Status

If the COD command is successfully implemented, the COD_STATUS register will output 0x00 for the indication.

The non-zero value of COD_STATUS indicates different modes of failure. Refer to 5.7 Calibration-On-Demand (COD)
Status Register for details.

14.4 Save and Restore the New Gain Parameters

After a successful COD, the new gains with COD correction will be applied to the future data of X and Y axes of
Gyroscope. At the meantime, the new parameters are updated to the registers below, for host to read and save.

1. Gyro-X gain (16 bits) will be in dVX_L and dVX_H registers (0x51, 0x52)

2. Gyro-Y gain (16 bits) will be in dVY_L and dVY_H registers (0x53, 0x54)

3. Gyro-Z gain (16 bits) will be in dVZ_L and dVZ_H registers (0x55, 0x56)

If the host saved those gain parameters, it is possible to pass them back to the QMI8658A (without invoking again the
COD routine), using the CTRL9 command CTRL_CMD_APPLY_GYRO_GAINS (0xAA) as follow:

1. Disable Accelerometer and Gyroscope by setting CTRL7.aEN = 0 and CTRL7.gEN = 0

2. write Gyro-X gain (16 bits) to registers CAL1_L and CAL1_H registers (0x0B, 0x0C)

3. write Gyro-Y gain (16 bits) to registers CAL2_L and CAL2_H registers (0x0D, 0x0E)

4. write Gyro-Z gain (16 bits) to registers CAL3_L and CAL3_H registers (0x0F, 0x10)

5. Write 0xAA to CTRL9 and follow CTRL9 protocol

Once the CTRL9 command is successfully finished, the restored gains will take effects for future data of Gyroscope.

Note that it is always recommended to run the COD from time to time to apply the precise and up-to-date correction of
the Gyro-X and Gyro-Y sensitivity. Designer should be careful to restore the out-of-date gain parameters, especially
when there is significant change of PCB stress.

15 Self-Test (Check-Alive)

15.1 Accelerometer Self-Test

The accelerometer Self-Test (Check-Alive) is used to determine if the accelerometer is functional and working within
acceptable parameters.
It is implemented by applying an electrostatic force to actuate each of the three X, Y, and Z axis of the accelerometer.
If the accelerometer mechanical structure responds to this input stimulus by sensing at least 200 mg, then the
accelerometer can be considered functional.
The accelerometer Self-Test data is available to be read at registers dVX_L, dVX_H, dVY_L, dVY_H, dVZ_L and
dVZ_H. The Host can initiate the Self-Test at any time with the following procedure.
Procedure for accelerometer Self-Test:
1- Disable the sensors (CTRL7 = 0x00).
2- Set proper accelerometer ODR (CTRL2.aODR) and bit CTRL2.aST (bit7) to 1 to trigger the Self-Test.
3- Wait for QMI8658A to drive INT2 to High, if INT2 is enabled (CTRL1.bit4 = 1), or STATUSINT.bit0 is set to 1.
4- Set CTRL2.aST(bit7) to 0, to clear STATUSINT1.bit0 and/or INT2.
5- Check for QMI8658A drives INT2 back to Low, and sets STATUSINT1.bit0 to 0.
6- Read the Accel Self-Test result:

X channel: dVX_L and dVX_H (registers 0x51 and 0x52)
Y channel: dVY_L and dVY_H (registers 0x53 and 0x54)
Z channel: dVZ_L and dVZ_H (registers 0x55 and 0x56)

The results are 16-bits in format signed U5.11, resolution 0.5mg (1 / 2^11 g).
If the absolute results of all three axes are higher than 200mg, the accelerometer can be considered functional.
Otherwise, the accelerometer cannot be considered functional.
Note that, the Self-Test function will automatically set the full-scall to 16g and use the aODR set by user (CTRL2.aODR).
At the end of Self-Test, QMI8658A will update CTR2 with the original value user set before starting the Check-Alive)
routine.
The typical time for Self-Test (from setting aST to 1, until the rising edge of INT2 if enabled, or STATUSINT.bit0 is set
to 1) costs about 25 ODRs:
25ms @ 1KHz ODR
800ms @ 32Hz ODR
2.2s @ 11Hz ODR

15.2 Gyroscope Self-Test

The gyroscope Self-Test (Check-Alive) is used to determine if the gyroscope is functional.
It is implemented by applying an electrostatic force to actuate each of the three X, Y, and Z axis of the gyroscope and
measures the mechanical response on the corresponding X, Y, and Z axis. If the equivalent magnitude of the gyroscope
output is greater than 300dps for each axis, the gyroscope can be considered as functional.
The gyroscope Self-Test data is available to be read at output registers dVX_L, dVX_H, dVY_L, dVY_H, dVZ_L &
dVZ_H. The Host can initiate the Self-Test anytime with the following procedure.
Procedure for gyroscope Self-Test:
1- Disable the sensors (CTRL7 = 0x00).
2- Set the bit gST to 1. (CTRL3.bit7 = 1’b1).
3- Wait for QMI8658A to drive INT2 to High, if INT2 is enabled, or STATUSINT.bit0 is set to 1.
4- Set CTRL3.aST(bit7) to 0, to clear STATUSINT1.bit0 and/or INT2.
5- Check for QMI8658A drives INT2 back to Low, or sets STATUSINT1.bit0 to 0.
6- Read the Gyro Self-Test result:
X channel: dVX_L and dVX_H (registers 0x51 and 0x52)
Y channel: dVY_L and dVY_H (registers 0x53 and 0x54)
Z channel: dVZ_L and dVZ_H (registers 0x55 and 0x56)

<!-- page: 75 -->
Read the 16 bits result in format signed U12.4, resolution is 62.5mdps (1 / 2^4 dps).
If the absolute results of all three axes are higher than 300dps, the gyroscope can be considered functional. Otherwise,
the gyroscope cannot be considered functional.

Note that, the Self-Test function will automatically set the full-scale (gFS) and ODR (gODR) of CTRL3. At the end of
Self-Test, QMI8658A will update CTR3 with the original value user set before starting the Self-Test routine.
The typical time (from writing gST to 1, until the rising edge of INT2 if enabled, or STATUSINT.bit0 set to 1) cost for the
Self-Test process is about 400ms.

16 Host Serial Interface
QMI8658A Host Serial Interface supports slave interfaces of I2C, MIPI I3C and SPI. For SPI, it supports both 3-wire and
4-wire modes. The basic timing characteristics for the interface are described below. Through the QMI8658A Host
Serial Interface, the host can access, setup and control the QMI8658A UI Registers.

16.1 Address Auto Increment

During burst reads and writes, the target address can be configured in Auto-Increment or Non-Increment, by
CTRL1.ADDR_AI(bit 6), refer to 5.3.

For example, during burst read(burst write is similar) started from register 0x0B(CAL1_L):

If ADDR_AI = 0, the register address will not increase, and QMI8658A will output the content of CAL1_L, CAL1_L,
CAL1_L …, as long as host continues the burst read clock;

If ADDR_AI = 1, the register address will automatically increase, and QMI8658A will output the content of CAL1_L,
CAL1_H, CAL2_L …, as long as host continues the burst read clock.

Note that the default value of ADDR_AI is 0, so it is recommended to set it to 1 from beginning, in case of burst
read/write is required.

Note that, burst writes to Configuration Registers(refer to Table 22) are NOT supported. These registers should be
written in single cycle mode only.

16.2 Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

16.2.1 SPI Features
QMI8658A supports both 3-wire and 4-wire modes in the SPI slave interface. The SPI 4-wire mode uses two control
lines (CS, SPC) and two data lines (SDI, SDO). The SPI 3-wire mode uses the same control lines and one bi-directional
data line (SDIO). The SDI /SDIO pin is used for both 3- and 4-wire modes and is configured based on the mode
selected.

SPI transactions can be done in either Mode 0 (CPOL=0, CPHA=0) or Mode 3 (CPOL=1, CPHA=1). The QMI8658A
interface automatically detects which mode is in use and configures clocking accordingly.

SPI 3- or 4-wire modes are configured by setting CTRL1.bit7. SPI 3-wire mode is selected when CTRL1.bit7 = 1. The
default configuration is SPI 4-wire mode, that CTRL1.bit7 is 0.

Figure 28 shows the SPI address and data formats.

SPI Features
▪ Data is latched on the rising edge of the clock
▪ Data should change on falling edge of clock
▪ Maximum frequency is 15 MHz
▪ Data is delivered MSB first
▪ Support single read/writes and multi cycle (Burst) read/writes.
▪ NOTE: burst writes to Configuration Registers(refer to Table 22) are NOT supported. These registers should be
written in single cycle mode only.
▪ Supports 7-bit Address format and 8-bit data format

Figure 28. SPI Address and Data Format

16.2.2 SPI Interface Connection
In a typical SPI Master and Multi-Slave configuration, the SPI master shares the SPI clock (SPC), the serial data input
(SDI), and the Serial Data Output (SDO) with all the connected SPI slave devices. Unique Chip Select (CS) lines
connect each SPI slave to the master.

Figure 29. Typical SPI 4-Wire Connection

Figure 29 and Figure 30 show typical multi-slave 4- and 3-wire configurations. The primary difference between the two
configurations is that the SDI and SDO lines are replaced by the bi-directional SDIO line. The SDIO line is driven by
the master with both address and data when it is configured for write mode. During read mode, the SDIO line is driven
by the master with the address, and subsequently driven by the “addressed” slave with data.

16.3 I2C Interface

16.3.1 I2C Slave Address Selection
During the slave device selection phase, the I2C master supplies the 7-bit I2C slave device address to enable the
QMI8658A. When SA0 is pulled down externally, the 7-bit device address becomes 0x6B (0b1101011). The 7-bit device
address for the QMI8658A is 0x6A (0b1101010) if SA0 is pulled up or left unconnected. Note that internally there is a
weak pull-up of 200K and this pull-up resistor will be automatically disabled after the detection of I2C slave address
during the Reset Process, refer to 7.4.

16.3.2 I2C Interface Characteristics
